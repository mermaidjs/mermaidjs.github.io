# mermaid

## Special note regarding version 8.2

In version 8.2 a security improvement was introduced. A securityLevel configuration was introduced which sets the level of trust to be used on the parsed diagrams.

* **true**: (default) tags in text are encoded, click functionality is disabled
* false: tags in text are allowed, click functionality is enabledClosed issues: 

⚠️ **Note** : This changes the default behaviour of mermaid so that after upgrade to 8.2, if the securityLevel is not configured, tags in flowcharts are encoded as tags and clicking is prohibited.

If your application is taking resposibility for the diagram source security you can set the securityLevel accordingly. By doing this clicks and tags are again allowed.

```javascript
    mermaidAPI.initialize({
        securityLevel: 'loose'
    });
```

**🖖 Keep a steady pulse: mermaid needs more Collaborators [#866](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid/issues/866)**

Generation of diagrams and flowcharts from text in a similar manner as markdown.

Ever wanted to simplify documentation and avoid heavy tools like Visio when explaining your code?

This is why mermaid was born, a simple markdown-like script language for generating charts from text via javascript.

**Mermaid was nomiated and won the JS Open Source Awards (2019) in the catory The most existing use of technology!!! Thanks to all involved, people committing pull requests, people answering questions and special thanks to Tyler Long who is helping me maintain the project.**

# Request for assistance

Things are piling up and I have hard time keeping up. To remedy this
it would be great if we could form a core team of developers to cooperate
with the future development mermaid.

As part of this team you would get write access to the repository and would
represent the project when answering questions and issues.

Together we could continue the work with things like:
* adding more types of diagrams like mindmaps, ert diagrams etc
* improving existing diagrams

Don't hesitate to contact me if you want to get involved.


# For contributors

## Setup

    yarn install


## Build

    yarn build:watch


## Lint

    yarn lint

We use [JavaScript Standard Style](https://github.com/feross/standard).
We recommend you installing [editor plugins](https://github.com/feross/standard#are-there-text-editor-plugins) so you can get real time lint result.


## Test

    yarn test

Manual test in browser:

    open dist/index.html


## Release

For those who have the permission to do so:

Update version number in `package.json`.

    npm publish

Command above generates files into the `dist` folder and publishes them to npmjs.org.


# Credits

Many thanks to the [d3](http://d3js.org/) and [dagre-d3](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre-d3) projects for providing the graphical layout and drawing libraries!

Thanks also to the [js-sequence-diagram](http://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams) project for usage of the grammar for the sequence diagrams. Thanks to Jessica Peter for inspiration and starting point for gantt rendering.
